# Project as part of OpenClassrooms training
<br/>
The project is developed with PHP but without any framework.<br/>
It's a blog where administrators can publish, edit and delete posts.Besides, they validate or invalidate comments before it were published. They can also block, unblock or delete users. Every pages for all these actions are only accessible by administrators.<br/>
Only logged in users can comment inside each post page, but an administrator has to validate them before it can be published. Logged in users can fill out and send a contact form: an email is sent to administrators, otherwise an email is sent back to user if it is failed.<br/>
There are a login page and a register page as well.<br/>
